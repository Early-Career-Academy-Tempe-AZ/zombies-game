#Canvas Game

Poking around with canvas and trying to make stuff move and explode.. maybe with some zombies

Starting point was [this tutorial](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/) .. I'm just trying to arrange the code better in a way to be able to add explosions, zombies and multiple players later on..
